# Tink - FIPS 140-2

Currently, Tink is not
[FIPS 140-2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final)
validated itself. However, it supports several FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms and the
underlying implementations *can* utilize validated cryptographic modules like
[BoringSSLs BoringCrypto](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program/Certificate/3678).
Tink includes a
[WORKSPACE](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/cc/third_party/boringssl_fips)
for building BoringSSL in FIPS mode.

        ([FIPS 140-2 Annex A](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/fips/140/2/final/documents/fips1402annexa.pdf))

# FIPS-only mode

If you are required to use FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms and validated
implementations, then you can build Tink in FIPS only mode. This will restrict
usage to approved algorithms *and* check if Tink is utilizing a validated
cryptographic module.

Specifically this will change the behavior of Tink in the following way:

*   `Register()` functions will only register algorithms which have a FIPS
    validated implementation. This means that you will *only* be able to use
    Keysets for algorithms which use a validated cryptographic module.
*   Tink will check if BoringSSL has been build with the BoringCrypto module.
    Calls to primitives will return an `INTERNAL` error when the module is not
    available.
*   Using primitives in `subtle/` will be restricted to algorithms which utilize
    a validated cryptographic module.

Currently this is only supported in the C++ version of Tink.

If you are *not* building Tink in FIPS only mode, it will still utilize
validated implementations for *some* algorithms but not restrict the usage of
other algorithms.

## FIPS only mode in C++

Tink uses
[BoringCrypto](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program/Certificate/3678)
in C++ to provide access to a validated cryptographic module. Note that this
means that the following algorithms are not available, as they have not been
validated:

*   AES-CMAC
*   RSA-SSA-PKCS1 is restricted to 3072-bit modulus
*   RSA-SSA-PSS is restricted to 3072-bit modulus

In order to build Tink in FIPS-only mode, you can simply set a flag at compile
time:

```shell
bazel build ... --//third_party/tink/cc/config:use_only_fips=True
```

If you want to check at runtime whether Tink has been build in FIPS only mode,
you can include the header `config/tink_fips.h` which provides the constant
`kUseOnlyFips`.
